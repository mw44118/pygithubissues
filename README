I want to interact with github issues using python.

I'm following these docs: http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/

This code uses subprocess and curl.  It doesn't create a shell though,
so security risks are limited.

I welcome patches that replace using curl at the command-line with
something that either uses the pycurl, or something from the standard
library, or something like the requests or httplib2 libraries.
